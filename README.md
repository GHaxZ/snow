"**snow**" is a **randomly generated winter landscape screensaver**, which makes it possible for you to enjoy snowy landscapes, even when there's no sign of snow outside! (or if you don't like leaving your house)

You are presented with multiple ways to install snow:

- **Shell script**
  - Usable on Linux and macOS
  - No extra software required
  - No automatic updates
- **Powershell script**
  - Usable on Windows
  - No extra software required
  - No automatic updates

  - Usable on Linux and macOS

## Usage

To launch snow, simply run the snow command:

```bash

Once snow is running, you can use the following hotkeys:

That's all there is to it; it's quite simple, really.
